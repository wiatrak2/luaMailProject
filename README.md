-----------------

This is mail homework system implemeted in Lua and C++. The system is based on declaration system, which is used at the Institute of Computer Science at University of Wroclaw. The clue of system is to automaticly send few questions from question set to all students (random quests for each) and collect the answers and randomly pick some of them to verify by lecturer. The system is also making stats in `.csv` file. Examples of required config files are in `exampleFiles` directory, while `src` contains the code.
